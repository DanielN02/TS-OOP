# Typescript OOP

Object Oriented Programming is a style of programming that prioritizes classes and objects over logic and function. It can be very useful when managing large sets of data while still easily reusing parts of the data and keeping an heirachy. A few examples where OOP may be used in applications we used in our daily lives are banking apps, web searches, social media and more. Data modifiers are used to allow access to certain classes and methods in the code.

## TypeScript - Data Modifiers

### Static

The Static Data Modifier can only be accessed directly on the class and not extend from another. It enables developers to use methods of a class without creating an object first.

### Protected

The Protected Data Modifier ensures that data is kept private and can only be accessed through the classes that they may extend from.

### Private

The Private Data Modifier is similar to the protected modififier and keeps the information private. Some example of why we may want to use a private modifier for our data is to hid sensitive information like SSN, Account details, and etc.
